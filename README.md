# Nondeterministic-Finite-State-Machine-Simulator
Simplistic nondeterministic finite state machine (NFA) simulator. NFAs can be easily created by adding states and transitions in the main menthod in main.cpp. Additionally, main.cpp can be easily modified to accept a NFA in the form of a file; information necessary for states and transitions is obvious and parsable.
